    "- Container (Docker) – A container takes it a step further. It not only bundles Python and its packages, but also includes its own operating system and extra software if needed. That way, the project runs the same everywhere—whether you’re on Windows, Mac, or Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Virtual machine – A VM is like renting an entire computer in the cloud. It’s fully separate from your own machine, and you can even request special hardware like GPUs. That makes it great for big projects that need more power, but it’s more expensive and complex.\n",
