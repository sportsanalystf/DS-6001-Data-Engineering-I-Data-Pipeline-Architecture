Data Engineering I: Data Pipeline Architecture
Welcome to DS 6001: Practice and Application of Data Science!

In this course, we will be building data pipelines.

The pipeline refers to all of the steps needed to go from raw, messy, original data to data that is ready for any kind of analysis. In the real world, data is almost never ready to be analyzed without a great deal of work to prepare the data first. The goal of this course is to make this huge part of the job easier, faster, less frustrating, and more enjoyable for you. The techniques we will discuss are not the only ways to accomplish a task, but they represent fast and straightforward ways to do the work.
